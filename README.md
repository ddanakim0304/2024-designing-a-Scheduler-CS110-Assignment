# Designing-a-Scheduler-CS110-Assignment

### This is an assignment for 2024 Spring CS110: Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This project implements a scheduler that efficiently manages tasks with various dependencies, start times, and priorities using priority queues. The scheduler aims to organize tasks based on their start times and utility scores, ensuring optimal task completion.

### Key Features
- **Fixed-Time and Non-Fixed-Time Tasks**: Handles tasks with both specified start times and flexible schedules.
- **Priority Queue Implementation**: Utilizes max heaps to manage and prioritize tasks.
- **Utility-Based Scheduling**: Calculates utility scores to determine the order of non-fixed-time tasks.


### File Structure
- `Scheduler(with explanation).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with a full explanation of the algorithm, data structure, test cases, and evaluation.
- `max-heap(code only).py`: Python code for the maximum heap implementation.
- `Scheduler(code only).py`: Python code for the implementation of the scheduler and the priority queue.
