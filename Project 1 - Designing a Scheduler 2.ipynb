    "# Algorithmic Strategy\n",
    "## Priority Queue\n",
    "The reasons behind using a priority queue over other data structures are closely related to the nature of the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A priority queue is better at handling streaming input compared to other data structures like lists. If we are adding a new task to the scheduler, a priority queue can insert new tasks in O(logn) time (for a binary heap implementation), which is more efficient than re-sorting a list every time a new task is added, which would be O(nlogn) for each insertion.\n",
    "2. When we use a priority queue, the ordering can be based on various criteria, such as utility calculation or starting time. This characteristic is especially important because I am using two heaps with different priority criteria. For the fixed-time task heap, it considers the starting time to determine priority. For the non-fixed-time task heap, it uses utility to determine priority. Likewise, although the tasks fall under the \"Task\" class, depending on which heap they are in, the ordering criteria change.\n",
    "\n",
    "# General explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "My scheduler algorithm works as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define Priority Queues \n",
    "I am creating two priority queues, one for fixed-time tasks and one for non-fixed-time tasks.\n",
    "For fixed-time tasks, the priority within this queue is based on the start time; the earlier the start time, the higher the priority.\n",
    "For non-fixed-time tasks, the priority in this queue is based on a utility score. The utility score determines the order, with higher scores indicating higher priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Populate the Priority Queues for Fixed-Time Tasks\n",
    "For Fixed-Time Tasks: Place all tasks with a specified start time (tasks that have a \"start time\" value) into the fixed-time tasks queue, ordered by their start times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Schedule Fixed-Time Tasks\n",
    "Get tasks from the fixed-time tasks queue in order of their start times and schedule them into the scheduler.\n",
    "Check whether it starts after the given starting time. If so, cancel the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Populate the Priority Queues for Non-Fixed-Time Tasks based on Utility Equation\n",
    "Assign a utility score to each task that lacks a specific start time (tasks that do not have a \"start time\" value) and insert them into the non-fixed-time task queue. Utility calculation is done after scheduling fixed-time tasks as we have to know their priority. The utility score is determined by the formula: 3 * academic_career_importance + 1 * personal_interest + 1000 * sum of priority of fixed tasks dependent on this task + 50 * number of non-fixed tasks dependent on this task. This score reflects the task's importance in terms of academic and career goals, personal interest, and its dependencies on other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility score is designed to prioritize tasks by considering these elements in this following order: 1) sum of dependent fixed tasks' priorities (x1000 weight), 2) number of dependent non-fixed tasks (x50 weight), 3) academic and professional importance(x3 weight), and 4) personal interest (x1 weight). The maximum sum of academic importance and personal interest is 20 (5*3 + 5*1), so the number of dependent non-fixed tasks is more prioritized than academic importance & personal interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also ensures that the flexible task with dependent task to be performed first. For instance, if “CS110 PCW” and “AH112 PCW” are equivalent in terms of dependencies, academic and career importance, and personal interest, the task with a higher priority (earlier start time) dependent fixed task will be prioritized. In other words, if “CS110 class” (dependent on “CS110 PCW”) starts earlier than “AH112 class” (dependent on “AH112 PCW”), “CS110 PCW” will have a higher utility and will be executed first. It's important to note that the sum of priorities is computed such that higher priority tasks receive larger numerical values (e.g., in a scenario with two tasks, the first priority (\"CS110 class\") is valued at 2 and the second (\"AH112 class\") at 1). Furthermore, the utility score is based on the number of non-fixed tasks dependent on the tasks; the tasks with more tasks dependent on them should be prioritized to complete the task on time. Lastly, the weight assigned to academic and career importance is greater than personal interest, reflecting my current focus on career development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Schedule Non-Fixed-Time Tasks\n",
    "From a given starting time (e.g., 8am), start scheduling non-fixed-time tasks considering the fixed-time tasks. The task with the higher priority (higher utility) will be assigned first in the non-fixed-time tasks queue to the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler finds the earliest available time slot that accommodates the task's duration by checking whether the starting time and ending time of the scheduled task conflicts with the current task. If so, change the starting time of a task to the ending time of the conflicting task, until it finds a time slot that does not conflict with already assigned tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Check Dependencies and Return the Scheduler\n",
    "Since the prior step does not check whether scheduling non-fixed-time tasks aligns with the dependencies, after scheduling all the tasks, check whether each task's dependencies are completed. If there is no problem, return the final scheduler. If there is any issue in dependency, return the scheduler and state which tasks are conflicting."

    "Here, the worst case for schedule_flexible_tasks and the worst case for schedule_fixed_time_tasks are mutually exclusive. The worst case for schedule_flexible_tasks (where all tasks are flexible) represents the best case for schedule_fixed_time_tasks, while the worst case for schedule_fixed_time_tasks (where all tasks are fixed) represents the best case for schedule_flexible_tasks. Still, considering that the input type should fall between the worst case scenarios for both schedule_flexible_tasks and schedule_fixed_time_tasks, we can conclude that all input cases fall within this spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this premise, the worst case occurs when all tasks are flexible, where the most significant contributions come from the quadratic complexity of scheduling flexible tasks (O(n^2)). In this scenario, the complexity of schedule_fixed_time_tasks will be O(1), as there are no tasks within the fixed task heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the best case scenario where all tasks are fixed, the dominating complexity is O(1) for schedule_flexible_tasks, where k = 0. The time complexity would be dominated by O(n log n) for scheduling fixed-time tasks, while the complexity of scheduling flexible tasks remains O(1). Therefore, the best case time complexity is O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in practice, the average case time complexity could be viewed as somewhere between O(n log n) and O(n^2), heavily dependent on the distribution of task types and the structure of task dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I did not consider calculate_utility_scores as part of the most significant contributor (O(n*d)), because dependencies vary significantly based on the nature of the task (e.g., I only had 1 dependency in my task). If we briefly calculate it, the maximum number of dependencies will be n-1, excluding the original task. Therefore, when there are maximum dependencies, the time complexity will always be O(n(n-1)), simplified to O(n^2)."

    "## Benefits of my Algorithmic Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Efficient Management of Diverse Task Requirements: \n",
    "By separating tasks into fixed and flexible categories, I optimized scheduling efficiency. This allowed me to prioritize tasks with specific start times while filling available slots with flexible tasks, maximizing the scheduler's capacity and making the algorithm efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Utility Score Calculation:\n",
    "I introduced a method to calculate utility scores based on academic and career importance, personal interest, and dependencies. I assigned different coefficient to each factors to ensure that the tasks are scheduled based on its dependencies and importance, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the scheduling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Dynamic Rescheduling Based on Priorities: \n",
    "My scheduler dynamically adjusts schedules based on utility scores and task priorities, allowing for an adaptable and efficient system. This ensures tasks with higher utility are given precedence, optimizing productivity."

    "## Limitations and Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Handling Collisions: \n",
    "Initially, my scheduler didn't account for collisions between fixed-time tasks. I attempted to address this by comparing utility scores of colliding fixed tasks (see below code). However, this code didn't work because run_task_scheduler calculate utility after scheduling the fixed-time task, as my utility formula depends on the priority order of fixed tasks. Because of this, if I run this code, the utility for the fixed task will be 0, which cannot be compared. A potential improvement would be to schedule the fixed task, calculate utility, delete colliding fixed tasks, re-calculate utility, and then schedule flexible tasks. However, I failed to do so because there were too many cases to consider after deleting the colliding tasks (e.g., dependencies) among fixed tasks and updating utility calculations.\n"

    "I didn't explicitly address the management of idle time between tasks, which could lead to potential inefficiencies. During the ideation process, I considered adding a 'splitable' task that could be performed in multiple different time intervals (e.g., 1 hour to 10 minutes and 50 minutes), but it required excessive computation time due to recursively comparing utility.\n",
